Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Wikipedia
Developer(s): Junio Hamano and others


History

Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002.[14][15] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.[16] The same incident also spurred the creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.

Torvalds sarcastically quipped about the name git (which means "unpleasant person" in British English slang): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[24][25] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[26] The read-me file of the source code elaborates further:[27]

    "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

        random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
        stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
        "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
        "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks
